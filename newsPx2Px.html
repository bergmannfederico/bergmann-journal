                <p><span class="bentonMid firstSpan">YEREVAN, Armenia&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span>Armenia and Azerbaijan on Monday accused each other of attacks over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh despite a cease-fire deal brokered by Russia in an effort to end the worst outbreak of hostilities in the region in decades.</p>
                <p>The cease-fire <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-10-09/russia-offers-host-nagorno-karabakh-cease-fire-talks">came into effect Saturday</a> but was immediately challenged by claims by both sides of violations that persisted throughout the weekend and continued Monday morning.</p>
                <p>Armenian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said Monday that Azerbaijani forces were “intensively shelling the southern front” of the conflict zone. Officials of Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist, Armenian-backed government said Azerbaijan was directing “large number of forces” to the area of Hadrut, a town in the south of the region, where “large-scale hostilities” were ongoing.</p>
                <p>Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry called the Hadrut allegations “disinformation” and insisted that Azerbaijan was observing the cease-fire. The ministry accused Armenian forces of shelling the Goranboy, Terter and Agdam regions of Azerbaijan that lie around Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
                <p>Armenian military officials also said that Nagorno-Karabakh forces had shot down an Azerbaijani Su-25 warplane, a claim Azerbaijan denied.</p>
                <p>The recent bout of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces started Sept. 27 and <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-10-07/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-fighting-rages-on">has left hundreds of people dead</a> in the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh since a separatist war there ended in 1994. The region lies in Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia.</p>
                <p>The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a truce in Moscow after a series of calls by Russian President Vladimir Putin with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian.</p>
                <p>The cease-fire took effect at noon Saturday after talks in Moscow, which were sponsored by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The deal stipulated that the cease-fire should pave the way for talks on settling the conflict.</p>
                <p>If the truce had held, it would have marked a major diplomatic coup for Russia, which has a security pact with Armenia but has also cultivated warm ties with Azerbaijan.</p>
                <p>Both Armenia and Azerbaijan on Monday reiterated their commitment to the cease-fire deal and accused each other of violating it.</p>
                <p>Residents of Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital, which came under intense shelling last week, told the Associated Press on Monday that it didn’t feel like a truce to them.</p>
                <p>“We do not feel the cease-fire at all. We do not get out from here to our flats,” said Larisa Azeryan, who has been staying in a shelter in the basement of an apartment building. “We all stay here, we eat here, sleep here. The whole day is spent here in the basement.”</p>
